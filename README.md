## Explainability EU Bank Turnover Dataset
Background:

A medium size bank in Europe is looking at checking which clients accounts are going to be closed in the next 6 months. They have records of staying clients as well as clients who left.  

Goal:

    -Utilize bank data to create an explainable model for stakeholders and peer Data Scientist.
    -Perform basic EDA to understand preliminary Features, describe the dataframe
    -Use Lale to create a pipelies for feature selection, Hyperparameter Tuning and model selection.
    -Select the model from the lale pipelines models selection.
    -Use AIX360 and Lime tools to visualize and explain features amongst models, which were useful, which were not
    
    
Expectations:

    -All relevant information pertaining to the dataset, methods, and algorithims are properly cited and explained
    -Source code is bug-free and self-contained
    -Analysis is accurate and pertinent to task at hand
    -Finall results explain properly the features selected
    
To understand this notebook, a user is expected:

    -Basic understanding of Linear Algebra and its applications (outer, inner product, etc.)
    -Basic understanding of descriptive statistics
    -Understanding of Object Oriented Programming
    
To run:

    -If on Unix or Linux, press 'cmd' + 'spacebar' to open the search bar, type 'terminal' and hit enter
    -In terminal, type 'which python', to check which python you are currently running
    -If in python 3, type 'pip install jupyter lab pandas numpy tensorflow'
